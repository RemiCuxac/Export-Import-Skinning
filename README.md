# Export-Import-Skinning
A simple script that helps to export / import skin for Maya.
There is no interface, only two buttons in a shelf.
No need to re-bind the skeleton to the geo manually before an import of the skin. 
The skinning is here name-dependant so if some bones has the same name, a dialog will pop to rename them before.

# Installation : 
Drag and drop the file "DragAndDropToViewport.py" to the viewport of maya and two buttons will be created in the current shelf. 

### Compatibility
